The "Vehicle Information System" is a Java program created with the intent of illustrating essential object-oriented principles and the concept of inheritance in software development. It establishes a hierarchical structure of classes to effectively model various aspects of vehicles. This system encompasses several key classes: Manufacture, responsible for representing vehicle manufacturers; Engine, designed to define various engine types; and a class hierarchy for different vehicles, including ICEV (Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle), BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle), and HybridV.

The program adeptly demonstrates the intricate relationships between manufacturers, engine types, and distinct vehicle categories. It permits the instantiation of individual instances for each vehicle type and incorporates a method, showCharacteristics(), for presenting specific vehicle attributes. In the Main class, the initialization of vehicle data, encompassing manufacturer and engine type, occurs. Subsequently, the program iterates through an array of vehicles and showcases their distinctive characteristics.

This project serves as an instructive example for comprehending fundamental object-oriented concepts, including class inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It lays a solid foundation for more intricate systems related to vehicle management and information, making it a valuable resource for educational purposes.
